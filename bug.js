This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that depends on values from the component's state.  If the state changes, the function returned by `useCallback` is not updated, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `incrementCount` will only be created once because of the empty dependency array.  Subsequent state changes to `count` will not trigger a re-creation of the `incrementCount` function.  Thus, the closure inside `incrementCount` will always refer to the initial value of `count`.
